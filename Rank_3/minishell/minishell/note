-- Unquoted String ($test):

Variable Expansion: Like $test, the shell will expand the variable test to its value.

Word Splitting: If the value of test contains spaces or special characters (like newlines), the shell will split the value into separate words.

Filename Expansion (Glob Expansion): The shell will also expand any patterns like * or ? in the value of the variable if present.

-- Double-Quoted String ("$test"):

Variable Expansion: The value of test will still be expanded.

No Word Splitting: Spaces or special characters in the value of test will not cause the value to be split into separate arguments.

No Filename Expansion (Glob Expansion): No globbing will happen within the variable's value.
